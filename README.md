This is a working copy of the
[btree repository](https://github.com/tidwall/btree)
last updated on Jan 13, 2017...

The code in the **archive** directory is the original code.

The code in the **version** directory are working copies.

My code is in btree_util.go

If you diff the original code in archive and my btree.go you will
see the additions I made to enable terminal viewing
of the btree nodes.

To see the btree nodes simply type **gtv**
```
go test -v
```
